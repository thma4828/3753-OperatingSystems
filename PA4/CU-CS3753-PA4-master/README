Simple say make all to compile my code....
tests using default tests given in assignment. 

I was able to implement a slow LRU, and I had trouble with implementing a predictive pager. 

LRU and predictive pager are basically the same file, as I said was having trouble with using any sort of predictive paging that helped to speed
up the program at at all.
